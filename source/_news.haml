          Lang students Ana Hafley and Nivedita (Nivi) Gargi will be conducting their senior capstones in the lab. Ana is investigating how self reports of psychedelic experiences can give us insight into how we use language to express 'ineffable' phenomena, and the relation between ineffability and mysticism. Nivi will be collecting and analyzing <a href="https://ruthefoushee.com/resources/handouts/linguistic-self-portrait.pdf">language portraits</a> from children across New York City.
