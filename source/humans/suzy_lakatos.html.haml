          <p class="bio">Suzy is a PhD student in <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/nssr/phd-cognitive-social-developmental-psychology/">Cognitive, Social, and Developmental Psychology</a> at <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/nssr/">The New School for Social Research</a>. She focuses on what children's self-talk can reveal about their thinking patterns, learning processes, and self-soothing behaviors. Her previous work, conducted during her MA and MPhil training in Psychology, examined animacy and agency perception in virtual environments.</p>

          <p>At The New School, she has taught undergraduate research methods at <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/lang/">Lang College</a> for multiple years, managed the Student Research Awards program, and currently serves as a mentor in the Lang College Arts &amp; Humanities Research, Practice, and Creative Work program.</p>

          <p>Suzy also holds a graduate degree in Musicology from the <a href="https://concert.lisztacademy.hu/">Liszt Academy of Music</a> (Hungary) and previously worked as a professional violinist and teacher. She is broadly interested in how music and language complement one another across development, as well as in how emerging AI technologies may shape human communication and language use across different age groups. Her work is guided by a commitment to applying rigorous research methods to real-world questions that meaningfully improve people's everyday experiences, while maintaining strong standards of scientific integrity. Outside of the lab, she enjoys caring for her ever-growing collection of houseplants.</p>
