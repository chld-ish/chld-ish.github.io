          <p class="abstract">Sex robots and dolls are technologies designed for sexual engagement; caricatured human-forms sculpted to the heteromale gaze. Operatively, advanced sex robots talk, blink and move their head in limited degrees, while sex dolls remain minimally mechanic. Both, however, transcend strictly sexual utility, interweaving emotional intimacy aside physical. This inquiry explores the dynamic dialogues between sex robots and dolls and their human counterparts,  known as iDollators, challenging the conventional perception of these entities as mere extensions of human will and fantasy.</p>

          <p class="abstract">Anchored in anthropological methodology and informed by posthumanism, feminist new materialism, and Lacanian psychoanalysis, this research probes reciprocal identity and narrative construction between humans and sex robots and dolls within blog posts and social media where these entities are anthropomorphically represented. This work critically questions communicative dynamics and the capacity for non-human entities to influence human discourse, positioning sex robots as pivotal in reevaluating language, subjecthood, intersubjectivity and the anthropocentric paradigm. Thus, this research posits sex robots as potential interlocutors in their own right, navigating blurred boundaries between object and subject and inviting a radical reconsideration of what constitutes a 'source' of information and interaction.</p>

          <p class="abstract">Amidst a cultural milieu contesting legislative definitions of personhood, the stakes of this work emerge profoundly in the personal and the political. By acknowledging sex robots and dolls as potential subjects, this study confronts entrenched human primacy in knowledge production and linguistic interaction. It beckons a more inclusive understanding of language and agency, embracing the more-than-human world and enriching comprehension of the myriad modalities of expression and being within the collective social fabric. Consequently, this inquiry not only rethinks anthropological methods but also emphasizes the transformative potential of engaging with non-human entities as co-creators of our shared world.</p>
